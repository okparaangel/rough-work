Three traditional rulers in Anambra State, who bestowed chieftaincy titles on the senator representing Anambra South senatorial zone, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, have withdrawn them.

There has been a long drawn battle between Ubah and the Anambra State governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, stemming from the former’s quest to replace the latter as governor.

Ubah had late last year joined the All Progressives Congress, APC, and he is touted to be APC’s joker for Soludo’s ouster.
